# Javascript Testing - E2E

## Definition

End-to-end testing is a technique that tests the entire software product from beginning to end to ensure the application flow behaves as expected. It defines the product’s system dependencies and ensures all integrated pieces work together as expected.

The main purpose of End-to-end (E2E) testing is to test from the end user’s experience by simulating the real user scenario and validating the system under test and its components for integration and data integrity.

Software systems nowadays are complex and interconnected with numerous subsystems. If any of the subsystems fails, the whole software system could crash. This is a major risk and can be avoided by end-to-end testing.
